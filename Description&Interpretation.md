# Financial-Ratio-Analysis
This project analyzes year-to-year financial data (2020-2024) using Python to calculate key financial ratios such as Current Ratio, Debt-to Equity, and Equity Ratio. It includes data cleaning, ratio computation, and trend visualization using Matplotlib.

Interpretations: 
**Current Ratio (Liquidity Indicator)**
   -Trend: Increases sharply from 2020 to 2022, peaking in the year 2022, then it begins to decline in 2023, followed by a moderate rise in 2024.
   -Interpretation: This indicates improving short-term liquidity until 2022, suggesting the company could increasingly cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assests. The dip in 2023 may suggest either a reduction in current assests or an increase in current liabilities that year.
