# Financial-Ratio-Analysis
This project analyzes year-to-year financial data (2020-2024) using Python to calculate key financial ratios such as Current Ratio, Debt-to Equity, and Equity Ratio. It includes data cleaning, ratio computation, and trend visualization using Matplotlib.

Interpretations: 

**Current Ratio (Liquidity Indicator)**

   -Trend: Increases sharply from 2020 to 2022, peaking in the year 2022, then it begins to decline in 2023, followed by a moderate rise in 2024.
   
   -Interpretation: This indicates improving short-term liquidity until 2022, suggesting the company could increasingly cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assests. The dip in 2023 may suggest either a reduction in current assests or an increase in current liabilities that year.

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Leverage Indicator)**

   -Trend: Consistently low and declines from 2020, reaching it's lowest around years 2021-2022, slighly increasing in 2023, then dipping again in 2024.
   
   -Interpretation: A low and declining debt-to-equity ratio generally indicates conservative financing with more reliance on equity than debt. The small rise in 2023 may suggest a temporary increase in debt or reduction in equity.

**Equity Ratio (Fininacial Strengh)**

   -Trend: Steady increase over the years.
   
   -Interpretation: The company has a gradual increase in its equity financing relative to its total assets, indicating stronger financial stability and lower reliance on external debt.
